Description: This package provides shape-based clustering algorithms for multidimensional longitudinal data based on the Fréchet distance. It implements two main methods: MFKmL (Multidimensional Fréchet distance-based K-means for Longitudinal data), an extension of the K-means algorithm using the Fréchet distance originally developed in the kmlShape package, adapted for multidimensional trajectories; and SFKmL (Sparse multidimensional Fréchet distance-based K-medoids for Longitudinal data), a K-medoids-based clustering algorithm that incorporates variable selection. These tools are designed to enhance clustering performance in high-dimensional longitudinal data settings, particularly those with time delays, variations in trajectory speed, irregular sampling intervals, and noise. This package implements methods derived from Kang et al. (2023) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-023-10237-z>.
